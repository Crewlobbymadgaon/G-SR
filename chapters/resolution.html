    <p id="p1" style="margin:0 0 14px;"><strong>1.</strong> The considerable advance made in recent years in methods of signalling and interlocking, modes of traction and introduction of new types of equipment necessitated a revision of the General Rules, which had been revised last in 1929, for working Open Lines of Railways in India. The revision of these rules was also advocated by the Railway Accidents Committee, 1962, and the Railway Accidents Inquiry Committee, 1968, who desired that the revision of the Rules should be consistent not only with the conditions obtaining at present but likely to obtain in the foreseeable future, and emphasised the need for keeping the basic complexion of rules intact while at the same time providing for technological changes in recent years.</p>

    <p id="p2" style="margin:0 0 14px;"><strong>2.</strong> For this purpose, a committee composed of officers selected for the Traffic and Signal Departments was appointed by the Railway Board in 1968. The committee submitted a set of draft rules for consideration by the Board in February, 1970. The Commission of Railway Safety, whose comments were also invited, did not favour the adoption of these draft rules, which had proposed the abolition of certain existing fundamental concepts such as classification of stations, minimum equipment of signals for each class of station, etc. In the Annual Report for 1971–72, the Commission stated that a wholesale revision and rearrangement of the rules which formed the basis of train working and safety operations for over 100 years and which were ingrained in the minds of thousands of railway staff, would not be desirable. Accordingly, the Commission conveyed to the Railway Board its inability to agree to the adoption of the General Rules as drafted.</p>

    <p id="p3" style="margin:0 0 14px;"><strong>3.</strong> In consideration of the strong views expressed by the Commission of Railway Safety and the positive recommendations of the Railway Accidents Committee, 1962, the Railway Board decided in September, 1972, that the revision of the existing General Rules should be so undertaken as to be in consonance with these views and to cover such aspects only of the existing rules as required modification in the light of the technological changes or where certain existing rules had outlived their use. A fresh revision of the General Rules was accordingly taken up by the Safety Directorate in consultation with other Directorates of the Railway Board.</p>

    <p id="p4" style="margin:0 0 14px;"><strong>4.</strong> A provisional issue of the revised General Rules was circulated to the Railway Administrations; the Research, Designs and Standards Organization; the Commission of Railway Safety; Signal Engineering and Telecommunications, Secunderabad; Indian Railways Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Jamalpur; etc., for criticism and suggestions under Government of India, Ministry of Railways (Railway Board) letter No. 68-RR/2/Vol. V dated 25-7-1974.</p>

    <p id="p5" style="margin:0 0 14px;"><strong>5.</strong> The exhaustive views and comments received from the Railway Administrations; the Commission of Railway Safety; other Railway Institutions and the Ministry of Law, having been considered by Member Traffic, Railway Board, in consultation with the concerned Directorates, a complete revised set of General Rules for Railways administered by the Government have now been framed, sanctioned and issued by the Central Government.</p>

    <p id="p6" style="margin:0 0 14px;"><strong>6.</strong> The Central Government desire that the said rules may be brought to the notice of the Administrators of the several railways not administered by the Government and the Heads of Railway Administrations of such railways may be invited to submit a formal application for the adoption of the rules, with such modifications (if any) as may be considered necessary in each case.</p>

    <p style="margin:12px 0 10px;"><strong>Order:</strong> Order that this Resolution, with its enclosures, be published under a notification in the Official Gazette as required by Section 60 &amp; 87 of the Railway Act, 1989 (24 of 1989), and that a copy thereof be kept open for inspection at railway stations as directed by subsection (4) of the same section; also that a copy of this Resolution and of its enclosures be communicated to the Governments, Administrations and Officers, noted below, for information.</p>
